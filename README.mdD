# React Form Handling with Controlled Components & Formik

This project demonstrates two approaches for managing form data in React:

1. **Controlled Components** using React's `useState`.
2. **Formik** + Yup for modern, scalable form handling and validation.

The example consists of a registration form with the fields:
- **Username**
- **Email**
- **Password**
